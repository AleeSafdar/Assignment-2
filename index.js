Q(1):differentiating errors and bugs

a bug refers to a flaw or defect in the code, while an error refers to a mistake or incorrect operation in the program's execution.(ChatGpt)

Kinds of Bugs 
Logical , SyntaxError , Runtime error

1=Logical error occurs when the code doesnt give u the expected output due to wrong implementation of the code in the program. If suppose u have made the program of Multiplication and the Javascript is answering it in the positive form and it wont show any error in console so it is called a "difficult to debug error"


2=Syntax error occurs if a developer violates the rules ex
var 1name = "Safdar" // It doesnt appear to be the rule of variables

3=Runtime error occurs when the program encounters an unexpected condition during its execution, such as trying to access an undefined var 




  Q(2):Expressions and Statements
Statements examples 
any valid code in Javascript is called an statement
let name= "Safdar ali"

Expressions:
if we are working on any nathematics evaluation like 
2+2 or 10/2 these are called expressions . 
  Logical expressions and fucntion calls are also its examples
